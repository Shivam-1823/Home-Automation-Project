# Home Automation Project
A Home Automation System is a smart system that allows users to control home appliances and systems (like lighting, fans, AC, security cameras, doors, etc.) remotely using a smartphone, computer, or voice commands.
It integrates hardware (like sensors, relays, and microcontrollers) with software (like mobile apps, web dashboards, or voice assistants).
